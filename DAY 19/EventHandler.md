| onclick         | Triggered when an element is clicked.           | `<element onclick="functionName()">`    | `<button onclick="alert('Button clicked')">Click Me</button>` | This event handler executes a function when the element is clicked.                                                                                                          |
| onsubmit        | Triggered when a form is submitted.             | `<form onsubmit="functionName()">`      | `<form onsubmit="validateForm()">...</form>`        | This event handler executes a function when the form is submitted. It's commonly used to validate form inputs before submitting.                                              |
| onload          | Triggered when a webpage finishes loading.     | `<body onload="functionName()">`       | `<body onload="init()">`                           | This event handler executes a function when the webpage has finished loading. It's useful for initializing scripts or elements upon page load.                              |
| onmouseover     | Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element. | `<element onmouseover="functionName()">` | `<div onmouseover="highlight()">...</div>`          | This event handler executes a function when the mouse pointer moves over the element. It's often used to provide visual feedback or trigger actions.                        |
| onmouseout      | Triggered when the mouse pointer moves out of an element. | `<element onmouseout="functionName()">` | `<div onmouseout="removeHighlight()">...</div>`     | This event handler executes a function when the mouse pointer moves out of the element. It's commonly used to revert changes made by onmouseover.                            |
| onchange        | Triggered when the value of a form element changes. | `<element onchange="functionName()">`  | `<input type="text" onchange="validateInput()">`   | This event handler executes a function when the value of the form element changes. It's useful for live validation or updating dependent elements.                             |
| onkeydown       | Triggered when a key is pressed down.          | `<element onkeydown="functionName()">` | `<input type="text" onkeydown="handleKeyPress()">` | This event handler executes a function when a key is pressed down while the element is focused. It's commonly used for capturing user input.                                |
| onkeyup         | Triggered when a key is released.              | `<element onkeyup="functionName()">`   | `<input type="text" onkeyup="handleKeyUp()">`      | This event handler executes a function when a key is released after being pressed down while the element is focused. It's useful for responding to user input.              |
| onfocus         | Triggered when an element gets focus.          | `<element onfocus="functionName()">`   | `<input type="text" onfocus="highlight()">`        | This event handler executes a function when the element receives focus (e.g., via clicking or tabbing). It's commonly used to provide visual cues or initiate actions.    |
| onblur          | Triggered when an element loses focus.         | `<element onblur="functionName()">`    | `<input type="text" onblur="validateInput()">`     | This event handler executes a function when the element loses focus. It's often used for validation or cleanup tasks after user interaction.                                 |

These event handlers can be attached directly to HTML elements as attributes (`on[event]`) or added dynamically using JavaScript (`element.addEventListener()`). They provide a way to respond to user interactions and other events occurring within a webpage.
