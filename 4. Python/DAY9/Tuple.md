# Understanding Tuples in Python

Tuples are another data structure in Python, similar to lists, but they are immutable.

## Tuple
- **Immutable**: Tuples cannot be modified after creation.

```python
person = ("Sanjana", "India", 20)
```

### Code Explanation
- Tuples are created using parentheses `()`.
- Elements in a tuple are accessed using indexing, similar to lists.
- Attempts to modify elements in a tuple result in an error.

```python
print(person[0], person[2])  # Output: Sanjana 20
```

## Tuple Characteristics

### Modification
Tuples do not allow modification of their elements, unlike lists.

```python
# person[0] = "Sneha"  # ‚ùå
```

### Methods
Tuples support methods like `count()` and `index()` for basic operations.

```python
print(person.count(20))    # Output: 2
print(person.index("India"))  # Output: 1
```

## Difference from Lists

Tuples differ from lists mainly in their immutability, making them suitable for representing fixed collections of items.

### Removal and Addition
Unlike lists, tuples do not support methods like `pop()` or `remove()` for removal, or `append()` and `insert()` for addition.

```python
# person_list[0] = "Sneha"  # Modification allowed for lists
# person[0] = "Sneha"        # Modification not allowed for tuples
```

### Error Handling
The `index()` and `find()` methods are used to search for a substring or element within a string or list, respectively. However, they differ in how they handle cases where the substring or element is not found.

#### index() Method

The `index()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring or element within a string or list. If the substring or element is not found, the method raises a ValueError.

```python
string = "hello world"
index = string.index("o")
print(index)  # Output: 4

# Raises a ValueError if substring is not found
# string.index("z")
```

#### find() Method

The `find()` method is similar to `index()`, but it returns `-1` if the substring or element is not found instead of raising an error.

```python
string = "hello world"
index = string.find("o")
print(index)  # Output: 4

# Returns -1 if substring is not found
index = string.find("z")
print(index)  # Output: -1
```

The `find()` method is particularly useful when you want to check if a substring exists in a string without raising an error.

These methods are handy for searching within strings or lists and handling cases where the target substring or element may or may not be present.


**Tuples are particularly useful for representing fixed collections of elements that should not be modified after creation.**

This explanation provides a clear understanding of tuples in Python, highlighting their immutability, usage, and differences from lists.
