## The `all()` and `any()` functions are built-in Python functions used for evaluating iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) containing boolean values. 

- `all()`: Returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are `True`, otherwise returns `False`. It's similar to the logical "and" operation.
- `any()`: Returns `True` if at least one element in the iterable is `True`, otherwise returns `False`. It's similar to the logical "or" operation.

Let's break down the code snippet:

```python
print(all([True, False, True]))  # False - and
print(any([True, False, True]))  # True - or
```

- `all([True, False, True])`: This evaluates to `False` because not all elements in the list are `True`. In the logical "and" operation, if any element is `False`, the result is `False`.
- `any([True, False, True])`: This evaluates to `True` because at least one element in the list is `True`. In the logical "or" operation, if any element is `True`, the result is `True`.

```python
marks = [50, 40, 20, 90]
# Pass 40% or more
```

This code seems to be checking whether a student's marks meet the passing criteria. Let's calculate the percentage of marks obtained and determine if the student will get a passing grade.

```python
marks = [50, 40, 20, 90]

# Calculate the total marks
total_marks = sum(marks)

# Calculate the percentage
percentage = (total_marks / (len(marks) * 100)) * 100

# Check if the percentage is greater than or equal to 40%
if percentage >= 40:
    print("Yes, the student will get a passing grade")
else:
    print("No, the student will not get a passing grade")
```

- If the percentage of marks obtained is 40% or more, the output will be "Yes, the student will get a passing grade".
- If the percentage of marks obtained is less than 40%, the output will be "No, the student will not get a passing grade".
