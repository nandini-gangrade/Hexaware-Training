### Section 1: Definition of Classes and Students

```python
classes = {
    "Class A": [
        {"name": "Alice", "grades": [82, 90, 88]},
        {"name": "Bob", "grades": [78, 81, 86]},
        {"name": "Charlie", "grades": [85, 85, 87]},
        {"name": "Alex", "grades": [85, 90, 87]},
    ],
    "Class B": [
        {"name": "Dave", "grades": [92, 93, 88]},
        {"name": "Eve", "grades": [76, 88, 91]},
        {"name": "Frank", "grades": [88, 90, 92]},
    ],
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- This section defines a dictionary named `classes`.
- Each key in the dictionary represents a class ("Class A" and "Class B").
- The value corresponding to each key is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a student.
- Each student dictionary contains the keys "name" (student's name) and "grades" (a list of student's grades).

### Section 2: Task 1 - Finding the Average of Entire Class

```python
def find_avg(items):
    return round(sum(items) / len(items), 2)

class_avg = {
    class_name: find_avg([find_avg(student["grades"]) for student in students])
    for class_name, students in classes.items()
}

print(class_avg)
```

**Explanation**: 
- This section calculates the average grade for each class.
- The `find_avg()` function calculates the average of a list of numbers.
- Dictionary comprehension is used to iterate over each class and its students.
- For each class, it calculates the average grade of each student using list comprehension.
- Then, it calculates the average grade for the entire class.
- Finally, it prints a dictionary containing the average grades for each class.

**Output**: 
```python
{'Class A': 85.33, 'Class B': 88.67}
```

### Section 3: Task 2 - Finding the Average of Each Student

```python
class_wise_student_avg = {}
for class_name, students in classes.items():
    class_student_avg = {}
    for student in students:
        avg = find_avg(student["grades"])
        class_student_avg[student["name"]] = avg
    class_wise_student_avg[class_name] = class_student_avg

print(class_wise_student_avg)
```

**Explanation**: 
- This section calculates the average grade for each student in each class.
- Nested loops iterate over each class and its students.
- For each student, it calculates the average grade.
- The result is stored in a nested dictionary where keys are class names and values are dictionaries containing student names and their average grades.

**Output**: 
```python
{'Class A': {'Alice': 86.67, 'Bob': 81.67, 'Charlie': 85.67, 'Alex': 87.33}, 'Class B': {'Dave': 91.0, 'Eve': 85.0, 'Frank': 90.0}}
```

These sections illustrate how the provided code calculates the average grades for entire classes and individual students within those classes. It demonstrates the use of functions, loops, list comprehension, and dictionary comprehension to efficiently process and analyze data.
