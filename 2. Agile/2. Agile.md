# Waterfall And Agile Methodologies
![WhatsApp Image 2024-04-23 at 16 53 54_829b7117](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Hexaware-Python-Training/assets/87817417/970c5d78-fe54-4e6e-806a-bebf293d2ff1)

The main differences between the Waterfall and Agile software development methodologies:

| Aspect          | Waterfall Methodology                            | Agile Methodology                             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**    | Sequential, linear approach.                     | Iterative and incremental approach.          |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible, changes are difficult to accommodate once the development phase begins. | More flexible, changes can be accommodated easily even late in the development cycle. |
| **Requirements**| All requirements are gathered upfront and documented in detail. | Requirements are gathered incrementally and can evolve throughout the project. |
| **Delivery**    | Final product is delivered at the end of the development cycle. | Product features are delivered incrementally in short iterations, often in 2-4 weeks. |
| **Feedback**    | Limited customer involvement until the end of the project. | Continuous customer feedback and collaboration throughout the project. |
| **Risk**        | Higher risk of late-stage project failures.      | Risks are mitigated early through iterative development and frequent testing. |
| **Adaptability**| Less adaptable to changes in project scope or requirements. | Adaptable to changes, priorities, and customer feedback. |
| **Team Size**   | Suitable for large, well-defined projects with stable requirements. | Suited for small to medium-sized projects with evolving requirements. |
| **Documentation**| Extensive documentation at each stage of the process. | Emphasis on working software over comprehensive documentation. |

## Agile Implementation (SCRUM)

### Sprint Meetings:

#### 1. Sprint Planning Meeting:
- **Purpose:** Held at the beginning of each Sprint, typically lasting up to 8 hours for a one-month Sprint.
- **Participants:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Agenda:**
  - Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the Product Backlog.
  - Development Team selects items they believe they can complete within the Sprint and commits to the Sprint Goal.
  - Tasks are identified and estimated by the Development Team.
  - Sprint Backlog is created, detailing the work to be done during the Sprint.

#### 2. Sprint Review Meeting:
- **Purpose:** Held at the end of each Sprint, typically lasting up to 4 hours for a one-month Sprint.
- **Participants:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team, Stakeholders.
- **Agenda:**
  - Development Team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders.
  - Product Owner reviews the increment and gathers feedback from stakeholders.
  - Product Backlog is updated based on stakeholder input and new insights.
  - Sprint Review concludes with a discussion of what was done, what was not done, and any lessons learned.

#### 3. Sprint Retrospective Meeting:
- **Purpose:** Held after the Sprint Review, typically lasting up to 3 hours for a one-month Sprint.
- **Participants:** Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Agenda:**
  - Reflect on the Sprint process, identifying what went well and what could be improved.
  - Discuss any issues or impediments encountered during the Sprint.
  - Generate actionable items to enhance team collaboration, processes, and productivity for future Sprints.

### Stand-up Meetings (Daily Scrum):

- **Purpose:** Held daily, typically lasting 15 minutes, to synchronize activities, discuss progress, and identify any impediments.
- **Participants:** Development Team, Scrum Master (optional), Product Owner (optional).
- **Agenda:**
  - Each team member answers three questions: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any impediments blocking my progress?
  - Scrum Master facilitates the meeting, ensuring it stays focused and timeboxed.
  - Issues and impediments identified during the Stand-up are addressed promptly outside the meeting to keep the team moving forward.

## Unified View

**To check progress in a unified view, you can use project management tools or dashboards that provide a comprehensive overview of tasks, timelines, and progress. Here's how you can achieve this:**

#### Project Management Tools:
- **Trello:** Trello boards allow you to visualize tasks in lists or boards, providing a unified view of progress across different stages.
- **Jira:** Jira provides customizable dashboards where you can create widgets to track progress, monitor sprint velocity, and view burn-down charts.
- **Asana:** Asana offers project views where you can see tasks, timelines, dependencies, and progress in a unified layout.
- **Monday.com:** Monday.com provides customizable boards and dashboards that allow you to track progress, deadlines, and team workload in one place.

#### Gantt Charts:
- Use Gantt charts in project management software like Microsoft Project, Smartsheet, or TeamGantt to visualize project timelines, dependencies, and progress in a unified view.
- Gantt charts provide a timeline-based representation of tasks, allowing you to see task durations, dependencies, and progress at a glance.

#### Dashboard Widgets:
- Customize dashboards in project management tools to include widgets such as task progress bars, burndown charts, milestone trackers, and team workload summaries.
- Widgets provide real-time updates on progress and help you monitor key metrics in one consolidated view.

#### Status Reports:
- Generate status reports or progress summaries that consolidate information from different project management tools or sources.
- Status reports can include key metrics, accomplishments, milestones achieved, and upcoming tasks, providing stakeholders with a unified view of project progress.

#### Integration Platforms:
- Use integration platforms like Zapier or Integromat to connect multiple project management tools and aggregate data into a single dashboard or report.
- Integration platforms allow you to automate data synchronization and create customized views that consolidate progress information from different sources.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, you can create a unified view of project progress, enabling you to track tasks, milestones, timelines, and team performance in one place for efficient monitoring and decision-making.


### Kanban Board Example: 
Kanban boards are visual project management tools that help teams track and manage work in progress. Here's an example of a Kanban board with columns representing different stages of work:

![WhatsApp Image 2024-04-23 at 17 37 48_1aac80cf](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Hexaware-Python-Training/assets/87817417/b0fe1a5a-0608-403e-8a6e-a30974e1412e)

**Columns:**
1. **Backlog:** This column represents tasks that are planned but not yet started. Tasks in the backlog are prioritized and ready to be moved into the "In Progress" column when resources become available.

2. **In Progress:** Tasks in this column are actively being worked on by team members. Work in progress (WIP) limits may be applied to control the number of tasks being worked on simultaneously and maintain flow.

3. **Peer Review:** Tasks that have been completed or are nearing completion are moved to this column for peer review. Peer review ensures quality and accuracy before tasks are considered done.

4. **Done:** Tasks that have been completed and meet the required criteria are moved to this column. They are considered finished and ready for deployment or delivery.

**Workflow:**
- Tasks flow from left to right across the board as work progresses through different stages.
- Team members pull tasks from the backlog into the "In Progress" column based on their capacity and priority.
- Tasks move through peer review before being marked as done and moved to the "Done" column.
- Regular meetings or stand-ups may be held to review the board, discuss progress, and identify any impediments or blockers.

This Kanban board provides a visual representation of work items and their status, enabling teams to prioritize tasks, maintain workflow, and track progress in real-time.
