This table provides a comparison between similar services offered by AWS and Azure. While the services may have similar functionalities, there might be differences in features, pricing, and integration capabilities. It's essential to evaluate your specific requirements before choosing between AWS and Azure services.

## Create Account:

To create an Azure account, you can follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Azure Website**: Navigate to the Azure website by typing "azure.microsoft.com" into your web browser's address bar.
2. **Sign Up for Azure**: On the Azure homepage, click on the "Start free" button or "Sign up for free" link. This will take you to the Azure sign-up page.

4. **Provide Information**: Fill in the required information, including your email address, password, and country/region. Follow the prompts to complete the account creation process.
5. **Verify Your Identity**: After providing your information, you may be asked to verify your identity. This can be done through email, phone, or other verification methods.
6. **Provide Payment Information (Optional)**: While signing up for a free Azure account, you'll need to provide a credit card or debit card for identity verification purposes. You won't be charged unless you upgrade to a paid subscription or exceed the free usage limits.
7. **Agree to Terms and Conditions**: Read through the terms of use and privacy policy, then check the box to agree to the terms.
8. **Complete Sign-Up**: Once you've provided all the necessary information and verified your identity, click on the "Sign up" or "Create account" button to complete the sign-up process.
9. **Access Your Azure Account**: After creating your Azure account, you can sign in to the Azure portal using your Microsoft account credentials. From there, you can start exploring Azure services and managing your resources.

Remember to keep your account credentials secure and follow best practices for account management to protect your Azure resources.

## Create VM
To create a virtual machine (VM) in Azure, you can follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**: Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure account credentials.

2. **Navigate to Virtual Machines**: Once signed in, click on the "Create a resource" button (located on the left-hand side of the Azure Portal) and then select "Virtual machines" from the list of options.

3. **Start the Creation Process**: On the "Virtual machines" page, click on the "Add" button to start creating a new virtual machine.

4. **Configure Basics**:
   - **Subscription**: Choose the subscription you want to use for this VM.
   - **Resource group**: Either create a new resource group or select an existing one.
   - **Virtual machine name**: Provide a name for your VM.
   - **Region**: Select the Azure region where you want to deploy the VM.
   - **Image**: Choose an operating system image for your VM. You can select from a variety of options, including Windows Server, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.
   - **Size**: Choose the size of the VM based on your requirements and budget.

5. **Configure Administrator Account**:
   - Provide a username and password for the administrator account on the VM.
   - You can also use SSH public key authentication if you prefer.

6. **Configure Networking**:
   - Choose whether to create a new virtual network or use an existing one.
   - Configure networking settings such as subnet, public IP address (if needed), and network security group.

7. **Configure Management**:
   - Enable or disable monitoring options such as Boot diagnostics, OS guest diagnostics, and System assigned managed identity.
   - You can also enable auto-shutdown to automatically turn off the VM during non-business hours to save costs.

8. **Review and Create**:
   - Review all the settings you've configured for the VM.
   - Once you're satisfied, click on the "Review + create" button.

9. **Deploy the VM**:
   - Azure will validate your settings. If everything looks good, click on the "Create" button to deploy the VM.
   - Azure will now provision the VM based on your configuration. This process may take a few minutes.

10. **Access the VM**:
    - Once the VM is deployed, you can access it via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for Windows VMs or Secure Shell (SSH) for Linux VMs using the provided administrator credentials.

That's it! You've now successfully created a virtual machine in Azure. You can now start using the VM for your applications and services.
