## SQL Queries and Explanations

### Task 1: Average Commission of Salesmen from Paris

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT AVG(commision) 
FROM salesman 
WHERE city = 'Paris';
```
#### Explanation:
- **Aggregate Function (AVG)**: Calculates the average commission for salesmen in Paris.
- **Filtering with WHERE**: Limits the calculation to salesmen records with 'Paris' as their city.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using JOIN and Subquery):
```sql
SELECT AVG(s.commision)
FROM salesman s
JOIN (
    SELECT salesman_id
    FROM salesman
    WHERE city = 'Paris'
) p ON s.salesman_id = p.salesman_id;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with JOIN**: Filters salesmen records to include only those from Paris, then calculates the average commission.

#### Table Generated
| AVG(commision) |
|----------------|
| 0.135          |

### Task 2: Cities with Only One Salesman

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(salesman_id) 
FROM salesman 
WHERE city IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY city 
HAVING COUNT(salesman_id) = 1;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Grouping and Counting**: Groups salesmen by city and counts the number of salesmen in each city.
- **Filtering with HAVING**: Filters out cities with only one salesman.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using CASE statement):
```sql
SELECT city,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(salesman_id) = 1 THEN 'Only One Salesman'
        ELSE 'Multiple Salesmen'
    END AS status
FROM salesman 
GROUP BY city;
```
#### Explanation:
- **CASE Statement**: Categorizes cities based on the count of salesmen, indicating whether there's only one salesman or multiple salesmen.

#### Table Generated 
| city    | COUNT(salesman_id) |
|---------|---------------------|
| London  | 1                   |
| New York| 1                   |
| Rome    | 1                   |

### Task 3: Maximum Commission in Each City and Corresponding Salesmen

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT s.city, MAX(s.commision), t.name 
FROM salesman s 
JOIN salesman t ON s.salesman_id = t.salesman_id 
GROUP BY s.city;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Joining Tables**: Joins the salesman table with itself to find corresponding salesman names.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Groups results by city and finds the maximum commission in each city.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using WINDOW functions):
```sql
SELECT city, 
       MAX(commision) OVER (PARTITION BY city) AS max_commission,
       FIRST_VALUE(name) OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY commision DESC) AS top_salesman
FROM salesman;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Window Functions**: Computes the maximum commission and corresponding salesman using window functions, providing flexibility in data retrieval and analysis.

#### Table Generated
| city    | MAX(commision) | name      |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| London  | 0.15           | James Hoog|
| New York| 0.13           | Nail Knite|
| Paris   | 0.14           | Mc Lyon   |


### Task 4: Orders Issued by Paul Adam (Using Subquery)

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE salesman_id = (SELECT salesman_id FROM salesman WHERE name='Paul Adam');
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery**: Retrieves the salesman ID associated with the salesman named 'Paul Adam' to filter orders.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using JOIN):
```sql
SELECT o.*
FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.name = 'Paul Adam';
```
#### Explanation:
- **JOIN Operation**: Joins the orders table with the salesman table to filter orders attributed to Paul Adam directly.

#### Table Generated 
| ord_no | purch_amt | ord_date   | customer_id | salesman_id |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 70011  | 75.29     | 2012-08-17 | 3003        | 5007        |

### Task 5: Orders with Values Greater Than the Average Order Value for 10th October 2012

#### Query 1 (Using Subquery with AVG):
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders 
WHERE purch_amt > (
    SELECT AVG(purch_amt) 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE ord_date = '2012-10-10'
);
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with AVG**: The subquery calculates the average purchase amount for orders placed on 10th October 2012.
- **Comparison:** The main query selects orders with purchase amounts greater than the average calculated from the subquery for the specified date.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using JOIN and GROUP BY):
```sql
SELECT o.* 
FROM orders o 
JOIN (
    SELECT ord_date, AVG(purch_amt) AS avg_amt 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE ord_date = '2012-10-10' 
    GROUP BY ord_date
) AS avg_orders 
ON o.ord_date = avg_orders.ord_date 
WHERE o.purch_amt > avg_orders.avg_amt;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Join with Subquery:** The main query joins the `orders` table with a subquery that calculates the average purchase amount for orders placed on 10th October 2012.
- **Comparison:** It selects orders with purchase amounts greater than the average amount calculated from the subquery.

#### Table Generated 
| ord_no | purch_amt | ord_date   | customer_id | salesman_id |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 70003  | 2480.40   | 2012-10-10 | 3009        | 5003        |
| 70010  | 1983.43   | 2012-10-10 | 3004        | 5006        |
| 70013  | 3045.60   | 2012-10-10 | 3002        | 5001        |


### Task 6: Orders with Above-Average Amounts for Their Customers

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT customer_id, purch_amt, AVG(purch_amt) 
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING purch_amt > AVG(purch_amt);
```
#### Explanation:
- **Aggregate Function**: The `AVG()` function calculates the average purchase amount for each customer.
- **Grouping**: The `GROUP BY` clause groups orders by customer ID to compute the average purchase amount for each customer.
- **Filtering with HAVING**: The `HAVING` clause filters out orders where the purchase amount exceeds the average purchase amount for their respective customers.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using Subquery):
```sql
SELECT o.customer_id, o.purch_amt, avg_amt
FROM orders o
JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, AVG(purch_amt) AS avg_amt
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) t ON o.customer_id = t.customer_id
WHERE o.purch_amt > t.avg_amt;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with JOIN**: We use a subquery to calculate the average purchase amount for each customer. Then, we join this subquery with the orders table to compare each order's purchase amount with the average amount for its respective customer.
- **Comparison with WHERE**: In the main query, we filter out orders where the purchase amount exceeds the average amount using the `WHERE` clause.

#### Table Generated 
| customer_id | purch_amt | AVG(purch_amt) |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 3002        | 2400.6    | 2447.2733333333|
| 3008        | 250.45    | 250.45         |


### Task 7: Orders Attributed to Salesmen in New York and Paris

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.city IN ('New York', 'Paris');
```
#### Explanation:
- **JOIN Operation**: We use a `JOIN` to combine the orders and salesman tables based on the salesman ID to retrieve orders attributed to salesmen.
- **Filtering with WHERE**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only orders attributed to salesmen in New York or Paris.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using Subquery):
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders 
WHERE salesman_id IN (
    SELECT salesman_id 
    FROM salesman 
    WHERE city IN ('New York', 'Paris')
);
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery Filtering**: We use a subquery to retrieve the salesman IDs associated with salesmen in New York or Paris.
- **Filtering with IN**: The `IN` operator is used in the main query to filter orders based on the salesman IDs obtained from the subquery.

#### Table Generated by Query 1:
| ord_no | purch_amt | ord_date   | customer_id | salesman_id | salesman_id | name      | city      | commision |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 70002  | 65.26     | 2012-10-05 | 3002        | 5001        | 5001        | James Hoog| New York  | 0.15      |
| 70005  | 2400.6    | 2012-07-27 | 3007        | 5001        | 5001        | James Hoog| New York  | 0.15      |
| 70008  | 5760      | 2012-09-10 | 3002        | 5001        | 5001        | James Hoog| New York  | 0.15      |

#### Table Generated 
| ord_no | purch_amt | ord_date   | customer_id | salesman_id |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 70002  | 65.26     | 2012-10-05 | 3002        | 5001        |
| 70005  | 2400.6    | 2012-07-27 | 3007        | 5001        |
| 70008  | 5760      | 2012-09-10 | 3002        | 5001        |

### Task 8: Salesmen with More Than One Customer

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT t.name, t.salesman_id 
FROM salesman t
WHERE t.salesman_id IN (SELECT s.salesman_id 
                        FROM salesman s 
                        JOIN customer c ON s.salesman_id = c.salesman_id
                        GROUP BY s.salesman_id 
                        HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1);
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with JOIN**: The subquery joins the `salesman` and `customer` tables based on the salesman ID to count the number of customers for each salesman.
- **Filtering with HAVING**: The `HAVING` clause filters salesmen who have more than one customer, ensuring only those salesmen are selected.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using EXISTS):
```sql
SELECT name, salesman_id 
FROM salesman t
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 
              FROM customer c 
              WHERE c.salesman_id = t.salesman_id 
              GROUP BY c.salesman_id 
              HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1);
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with EXISTS**: This alternative approach uses a subquery with `EXISTS` to check if a salesman has more than one customer.
- **Correlation with Outer Query**: The subquery correlates with the outer query by checking the existence of customers associated with each salesman.

#### Table Generated 
| name      | salesman_id |
|-----------|-------------|
| James Hoog| 5001        |
| Nail Knite| 5002        |


### Task 9: Customers with Grades Higher Than Every Customer in New York

#### Query 1 (Original):
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customer 
WHERE grade > ALL (SELECT grade 
                   FROM customer 
                   WHERE city = 'New York');
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with ALL**: The subquery retrieves the grades of all customers in New York.
- **Comparison with ALL**: The main query selects customers with grades higher than all grades in New York, ensuring only those customers are included.

#### Query 2 (Alternative using MAX):
```sql
SELECT c.* 
FROM customer c
JOIN (SELECT MAX(grade) AS max_grade 
      FROM customer 
      WHERE city = 'New York') t ON c.grade > t.max_grade;
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with MAX**: This alternative approach calculates the maximum grade among customers in New York.
- **Join and Comparison**: The main query joins with the subquery result and selects customers with grades higher than the maximum grade in New York.

#### Table Generated
| customer_id | cust_name    | city      | grade | salesman_id |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 3001        | Brad Guzan   | London    | NULL  | 5005        |
| 3004        | Fabian Johns | Paris     | 300   | 5006        |
| 3007        | Brad Davis   | New York  | 200   | 5001        |
| 3008        | Julian Green | London    | 300   | 5002        |
| 3003        | Jozy Altidor | Moscow    | 200   | 5007        |

Sure, let's proceed with the alternative queries, explanations, and generated tables for the remaining tasks:

### Task 10: Orders with Amounts Smaller Than Any Amount for a Customer in London

WHERE o.purch_amt < ANY (
    SELECT o.purch_amt 
    FROM customer c 
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
    WHERE c.city = 'London'
);
```
#### Explanation:
- **Subquery with ANY**: The subquery retrieves all purchase amounts for customers in London.
