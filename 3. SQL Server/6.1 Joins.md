| INNER JOIN    | - Returns rows where there is a match in both tables         | - Most commonly used join type                               | ```sql SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key;```  | **Example:** Suppose we have two tables, "employees" and "departments", and we want to retrieve employees along with their departments. An inner join will return only those rows where there is a match in both tables. |
| LEFT JOIN     | - Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table | - Ensures all rows from the left table are included         | ```sql SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key;```   | **Example:** Similar to INNER JOIN, but ensures all rows from the left table are included, even if there are no matches in the right table.                                                                  |
| RIGHT JOIN    | - Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table | - Similar to LEFT JOIN, but ensures all rows from the right table are included | ```sql SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key;```  | **Example:** Similar to LEFT JOIN, but ensures all rows from the right table are included, even if there are no matches in the left table.                                                                 |
| FULL JOIN     | - Returns all rows when there is a match in either table      | - Ensures all rows from both tables are included             | ```sql SELECT * FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.key = table2.key;```   | **Example:** Returns all rows from both tables, combining the result of both LEFT and RIGHT JOIN.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| CROSS JOIN    | - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables             | - Useful for generating combinations of all rows             | ```sql SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;```                           | **Example:** Returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Equi Join     | - Special case of INNER JOIN where columns in both tables are compared using equality operator | - Used to match rows based on equality of specified columns  | ```sql SELECT * FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;```  | **Example:** Suppose we want to join the "employees" table with the "departments" table based on the "department_id" column to fetch the department name for each employee.                                  |
| Self Join     | - Joining a table to itself                                   | - Used to compare rows within the same table                 | ```sql SELECT e1.name, e2.name FROM employees e1 JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;``` | **Example:** Suppose the "employees" table has a "manager_id" column indicating the ID of the employee's manager. We can use a self-join to retrieve each employee's manager's name.                   |
| Natural Join  | - Automatically joins two tables based on columns with the same name | - Simplifies the join syntax by automatically identifying matching columns | ```sql SELECT * FROM employees NATURAL JOIN departments;```                | **Example:** Automatically joins the "employees" and "departments" tables based on columns with the same name (e.g., "department_id").                                                                                                                                 |


### Inner Join Example:

**Explanation:**
This example joins the "employees" table with the "departments" table based on the "department_id" column. It returns all columns from both tables where there is a match in the "department_id" column. The result includes employees along with their corresponding department information.

### Left Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Generated Table:**
| employee_id | name   | department_id | department_id | department_name |

| 5           | Sneha  | 1             | 1             | Engineering     |

**Explanation:**
This example performs a left join between the "employees" table and the "departments" table based on the "department_id" column. It includes all rows from the left table (employees) and only matching rows from the right table (departments). If there is no match in the right table, NULL values are included in the result.

### Right Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Generated Table:**
| employee_id | name   | department_id | department_id | department_name |

| NULL        | NULL   | NULL          | 3             | Marketing       |

**Explanation:**
This example performs a right join between the "employees" table and the "departments" table based on the "department_id" column. It includes all rows from the right table (departments) and only matching rows from the left table (employees). If there is no match in the left table, NULL values are included in the result.

### Full Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
FULL JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Generated Table:**
| employee_id | name   | department_id | department_id | department_name |
|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|

| NULL        | NULL   | NULL          | 3             | Marketing       |

**Explanation:**
This example performs a full outer join between the "employees" table and the "departments" table based on the "department_id" column. It includes all rows from both tables, and if there is no match in one table, NULL values are included in the result for the corresponding columns from the other table.

### Cross Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e 
CROSS JOIN departments d;
```

**Generated Table:**
| employee_id | name   | department_id | department_id | department_name |
|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|

| 5           | Sneha  | 1             | 3             | Marketing       |

**Explanation:**
This example performs a cross join (also known as a Cartesian join) between the "employees" table and the "departments" table. It returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables, resulting in a table with a number of rows equal to the product of the number of rows in each table.

### Equi Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name 
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Generated Table:**
| name     | department_name |
|----------|-----------------|
| Alice    | Engineering     |
| Bob      | Engineering     |
| Charlie  | HR              |
| Sneha    | Engineering     |

**Explanation:**
This example performs an equi join between the "employees" table and the "departments" table based on the "department_id" column. It returns the names of employees along with their corresponding department names, where there is a match in the "department_id" column.

### Self Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS employee_name, e2.name AS manager_name 
FROM employees e1 
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

**Generated Table:**
| employee_name | manager_name |
|---------------|--------------|
| Bob           | Alice        |
| Charlie       | Alice        |
| Sneha         | Bob          |

**Explanation:**
This example performs a self join on the "employees" table to retrieve the names of employees along with the names of their respective managers. It matches rows within the same table based on the "manager_id" column (which indicates the ID of the employee's manager).

### Natural Join Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
NATURAL JOIN departments;
```

**Generated Table:**
| employee_id | name   | department_id | department_name |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1           | Alice  | 1             | Engineering     |
| 2           | Bob    | 1             | Engineering     |
| 3           | Charlie| 2             | HR              |
| 5           | Sneha  | 1             | Engineering     |

**Explanation:**
This example performs a natural join between the "employees" and "departments" tables. It automatically joins the tables based on columns with the same name (e.g., "department_id"). The result includes all columns from both tables where there is a matching column name.

### Outer Apply Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name 
FROM employees e 
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT *
    FROM departments d
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
) AS d;
```

**Generated Table:**
| name     | department_name |
|----------|-----------------|
| Alice    | Engineering     |
| Bob      | Engineering     |
| Charlie  | HR              |
| Sneha    | Engineering     |
| David    | NULL            |

**Explanation:**
This example uses the OUTER APPLY operator to perform an outer join-like operation between the "employees" and "departments" tables. It returns all rows from the left table (employees) and the result of the correlated subquery (departments), matching rows where the department IDs are equal. If there is no match in the subquery, NULL values are included in the result for the corresponding columns.

### Cross Apply Example:
**Query:**
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name 
FROM employees e 
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT *
    FROM departments d
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
) AS d;
```

**Generated Table:**
| name     | department_name |
|----------|-----------------|
| Alice    | Engineering     |
| Bob      | Engineering     |
| Charlie  | HR              |
| Sneha    | Engineering     |

**Explanation:**
This example uses the CROSS APPLY operator to perform a cross join-like operation between the "employees" and "departments" tables, with an additional condition specified in the correlated subquery. It returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables where the department IDs are equal.

## SQL Commands: TASKS
#### **Table Creation:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT,
       Name VARCHAR(50),
       Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
       DepartmentID INT
   );

   CREATE TABLE Departments (
       DepartmentID INT,
       DepartmentName VARCHAR(50),
       MinSalary DECIMAL(10,2)
   );
   ```
   Explanation: These commands create two tables, "Employees" and "Departments", with specified columns and data types.

**Employees:**
   | EmployeeID | Name       | Salary | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------|--------|--------------|
   | 1          | John Doe   | 50000  | 101          |
   | 2          | Jane Smith | 40000  | 102          |

#### **Data Insertion:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees VALUES 
   (1, 'John Doe', 50000, 101), 
   (2, 'Jane Smith', 40000, 102);

   INSERT INTO Departments VALUES 
   (101, 'HR', 45000), 
   (102, 'Marketing', 35000);
   ```
   Explanation: These commands insert data into the respective tables. Each row represents an employee or department, with the corresponding details.

**Departments:**
   | DepartmentID | DepartmentName | MinSalary |
   |--------------|----------------|-----------|
   | 101          | HR             | 45000     |
   | 102          | Marketing      | 35000     |

#### **Select Commands:**
   ```sql
   Select * from Employees;
   Select * from Departments;
   Select Name, Salary, DepartmentName, MinSalary 
   From Employees 
   Inner Join Departments 
   on Salary > MinSalary;
   ```
   Explanation:
   - The first two commands simply select all records from the "Employees" and "Departments" tables, respectively.
   - The third command selects employee names, salaries, department names, and minimum salaries from the "Employees" table joined with the "Departments" table based on the condition that the employee's salary is greater than the department's minimum salary.

In terms of joins:
- The first two select commands represent basic queries without any join, similar to a natural join where no explicit join condition is specified.
- The third select command demonstrates an inner join (similar to equi join) between the "Employees" and "Departments" tables, with a condition comparing the employee's salary with the department's minimum salary. This condition acts as an explicit equi join condition, determining which rows to include in the result set based on matching criteria between the two tables.
