## Employee Data Management

### Create EmployeeData Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeData (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Salary INT,
    StartDate DATE
);
```

### Insert Data into EmployeeData Table

```sql
INSERT INTO EmployeeData (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, StartDate) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 70000, '2020-05-01'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 85000, '2018-08-15'),
(3, 'Emily', 'Jones', 94000, '2019-12-30'),
(4, 'Chris', 'Brown', 62000, '2021-03-22');
```

### Generated EmployeeData Table

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Salary | StartDate  |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1          | John      | Doe      | 70000  | 2020-05-01 |
| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | 85000  | 2018-08-15 |
| 3          | Emily     | Jones    | 94000  | 2019-12-30 |
| 4          | Chris     | Brown    | 62000  | 2021-03-22 |

## Task 1: Sort Employees by Length of First Names (Descending)

**Intuition:** This task sorts the employees based on the length of their first names in descending order. It's useful for understanding the distribution of name lengths in the dataset.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeData 
ORDER BY LENGTH(FirstName) DESC;
```

### Sorted Employees by Length of First Names (Descending)

| EmployeeID | FirstName | LastName | Salary | StartDate  |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 3          | Emily     | Jones    | 94000  | 2019-12-30 |
| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | 85000  | 2018-08-15 |
| 4          | Chris     | Brown    | 62000  | 2021-03-22 |
| 1          | John      | Doe      | 70000  | 2020-05-01 |

## Task 2: Get the Initials JD, JS, EJ, CB

**Intuition:** This task retrieves the initials of each employee by taking the first letter of their first name and the first letter of their last name.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(SUBSTRING(FirstName, 1, 1), SUBSTRING(LastName, 1, 1)) AS Initials
FROM EmployeeData;
```

### Initials

## Task 3: Extract and Display the First Three Letters of Each Employee's Last Name in Upper Case

**Intuition:** This task extracts the first three letters of each employee's last name and displays them in upper case. It provides a quick reference for the first few letters of each last name.

```sql
SELECT UPPER(SUBSTRING(LastName, 1, 3)) AS LastnamePrefix
FROM EmployeeData;
```

### Last Name Prefixes

| LastnamePrefix |
|----------------|
| DOE            |
| SMI            |
| JON            |
| BRO            |

## Task 4: Calculate Tenure of Each Employee in Complete Years as of Today

**Intuition:** This task calculates the tenure of each employee in complete years as of today. It helps in understanding how long each employee has been with the company.

```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, 
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), StartDate) / 365 AS TenureInYears
FROM 
    EmployeeData;
```

### Tenure of Each Employee (Years)

| EmployeeID | TenureInYears |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 2             |
| 2          | 4             |
| 3          | 2             |
| 4          | 1             |
