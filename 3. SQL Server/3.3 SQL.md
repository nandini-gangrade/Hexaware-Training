## SQL VS NO SQL

| Feature                      | SQL (Relational Database)                                      | NoSQL (Non-Relational Database)                        |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Model                   | Follows a structured data model with tables and relationships | Offers flexible schema design, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph databases |
| Schema                       | Requires a predefined schema                                    | Can have a dynamic or flexible schema                    |
| Query Language               | Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for queries               | Doesn't necessarily use SQL, may have its query language or APIs |
| Scalability                  | Vertical scalability (scaling up)                               | Horizontal scalability (scaling out)                     |
| ACID Compliance              | ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | May or may not be ACID compliant depending on the database |
| Transactions                 | Supports transactions                                           | May support transactions, but implementation varies       |
| Examples                     | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                                      | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase                     |


#### Examples:

1. **SQL Example:**
   - Database: PostgreSQL
   - Schema: 
     - Table: `employees`
       - Columns: `id`, `name`, `department`, `salary`
   - Query: 
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
     ```

2. **NoSQL Example:**
   - Database: MongoDB
   - Schema:
     - Collection: `employees`
       - Documents:
         ```json
         {
           "_id": ObjectId("60a825f83436eb054384b75e"),
           "name": "John Doe",
           "department": "IT",
           "salary": 75000
         }
         ```
   - Query:
     ```javascript
     db.employees.find({ department: 'IT' });
     ```

> These examples illustrate the differences in data modeling, schema, query language, and scalability between SQL and NoSQL databases.

### Exercise 13

1. **Add the studio's new production, Toy Story 4 to the list of movies:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Movies (Title, Director, Year, Length_minutes)
VALUES ('Toy Story 4', 'New Director', 2020, 110);
```
This SQL statement is inserting a new row into the `Movies` table. We specify the columns we want to populate (`Title`, `Director`, `Year`, `Length_minutes`) and provide the corresponding values for the new movie "Toy Story 4". The values are: Title = 'Toy Story 4', Director = 'New Director', Year = 2020, Length_minutes = 110.

2. **Add the record for Toy Story 4 to the BoxOffice table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Boxoffice (Movie_id, Rating, Domestic_sales, International_sales)
VALUES ((SELECT MAX(Id) FROM Movies), 8.7, 340000000, 270000000);
```
This SQL statement inserts a new row into the `Boxoffice` table. We need to specify the `Movie_id` which corresponds to the newly added movie "Toy Story 4". To get the `Movie_id`, we use a subquery `(SELECT MAX(Id) FROM Movies)` which retrieves the maximum ID from the `Movies` table, thus obtaining the ID of the newly inserted movie. The rating is set to 8.7, and the domestic and international sales are set to 340 million and 270 million, respectively.

> By executing these SQL statements, we effectively add the new movie "Toy Story 4" to the `Movies` table and its associated record to the `Boxoffice` table.

### Exercise 16

To create the `Database` table with the specified columns, we use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Here's how we can create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Database (
    Name VARCHAR(255), -- A string describing the name of the database
    Version FLOAT,     -- A floating point number of the latest version of this database
    Download_count INTEGER -- An integer count of the number of times this database was downloaded
);
```
This statement creates a new table named `Database` with three columns: `Name`, `Version`, and `Download_count`, each with their respective data types. The `Name` column is of type `VARCHAR` (variable character) with a maximum length of 255 characters, the `Version` column is of type `FLOAT` (floating point number), and the `Download_count` column is of type `INTEGER`. There are no constraints specified for this table.

ADD Aspect_ratio FLOAT;
```
This command adds a new column named `Aspect_ratio` to the `Movies` table with a data type of `FLOAT`. Now the table will have the following structure:

| Id | Title         | Director       | Year | Length_minutes | Aspect_ratio |
|----|---------------|----------------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 1  | Toy Story     | John Lasseter | 1995 | 81             |              |
| 2  | A Bug's Life  | John Lasseter | 1998 | 95             |              |
| 3  | Toy Story 2   | John Lasseter | 1999 | 93             |              |
| 4  | Monsters, Inc.| Pete Docter    | 2001 | 92             |              |

**2. To add another column named `Language` with a `TEXT` data type and set the default language to English:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Movies
ADD Language TEXT DEFAULT 'English';
```
This command adds a new column named `Language` to the `Movies` table with a data type of `TEXT` and sets the default value to 'English'. Now the table will have the following structure:

| Id | Title         | Director       | Year | Length_minutes | Aspect_ratio | Language |
|----|---------------|----------------|------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| 1  | Toy Story     | John Lasseter | 1995 | 81             |              | English  |
| 2  | A Bug's Life  | John Lasseter | 1998 | 95             |              | English  |
| 3  | Toy Story 2   | John Lasseter | 1999 | 93             |              | English  |
| 4  | Monsters, Inc.| Pete Docter    | 2001 | 92             |              | English  |

### Exercise 18

**1. To drop the `Movies` table:**
```sql
DROP TABLE Movies;
```
This command removes the `Movies` table from the database. Once executed, the table and all its associated data will be permanently deleted.

**2. To drop the `BoxOffice` table:**
```sql
DROP TABLE Boxoffice;
```
This command removes the `Boxoffice` table from the database. Similar to dropping the `Movies` table, once executed, the `Boxoffice` table and all its associated data will be permanently deleted.

> By dropping these tables, we are cleaning up the database and removing all the data and structures we've worked with throughout the exercises.
