# LIMIT, OFFSET, FETCH & DECLARE


## Pagination in SQL: 
Pagination is the process of dividing a large set of query results into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. It allows users to navigate through a large dataset systematically, typically by limiting the number of rows returned per page and providing options to navigate to the next or previous pages.

| `LIMIT` (MySQL)    | Limits the number of rows returned in a query     | Implementing pagination, preventing large result sets, improving performance   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite                        | Provides control over the number of rows returned, facilitating efficient querying    |
| `TOP` (T-SQL)      | Retrieves the specified number of rows            | Obtaining a limited set of rows from a query result                           | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Useful for limiting the result set size, especially when combined with ORDER BY clause |
| `OFFSET` (T-SQL)   | Skips a specified number of rows in a result set  | Implementing pagination, skipping initial rows                                  | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Useful for navigating through large result sets, particularly for paginated views       |
| `FETCH` (T-SQL)    | Retrieves a specified number of rows from a result set | Implementing pagination, fetching a fixed number of rows from a query result | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Provides a more concise syntax for limiting and fetching rows from a query result     |
| `DECLARE` (T-SQL)  | Declares a variable for use within a batch or stored procedure | Storing and manipulating temporary values, performing conditional logic         | SQL Server (T-SQL)                               | Enables dynamic SQL queries, parameterizing queries, and temporary storage of values  |

**Usage:**
- `LIMIT` is primarily used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite to limit the number of rows returned by a query. It's commonly used for implementing pagination or restricting large result sets.
- `TOP` is specific to SQL Server (T-SQL) and is used to retrieve a specified number of rows from a query result. It's helpful for obtaining a limited set of rows, especially when combined with the `ORDER BY` clause.
- `OFFSET` and `FETCH` are also T-SQL features used for pagination. `OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows in the result set, while `FETCH` retrieves a specified number of rows after the `OFFSET`. Together, they allow for efficient navigation through large result sets.
- `DECLARE` is a T-SQL statement used to declare variables within a batch or stored procedure. It's essential for storing and manipulating temporary values, performing conditional logic, and parameterizing queries.

**Why:**
- These features provide control over the result set size, facilitating efficient querying and improving database performance.
- Pagination techniques like `OFFSET` and `FETCH` are crucial for navigating through large datasets, providing users with a better browsing experience.
- `DECLARE` allows for the dynamic creation of variables, enabling the execution of dynamic SQL queries and parameterization of queries, which enhances code reusability and maintainability.

## Example

### Table Creation: Employees

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    DepartmentID INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary, DepartmentID) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 50000.00, 101),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 60000.00, 102),
(3, 'Alice Johnson', 55000.00, 101),
(4, 'Bob Williams', 48000.00, 103),
(5, 'Emily Brown', 52000.00, 101),
(6, 'Michael Davis', 58000.00, 102),
(7, 'Jessica Martinez', 53000.00, 103),
(8, 'David Rodriguez', 51000.00, 101),
(9, 'Maria Garcia', 59000.00, 102),
(10, 'James Wilson', 54000.00, 103);
```

| EmployeeID | Name             | Salary   | DepartmentID |
|------------|------------------|----------|--------------|

### SQL Commands:

#### 1. **Using `TOP` to Limit Rows:**
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Employees;
   ```
   **Purpose:** The purpose of this command is to retrieve a limited number of rows from the "Employees" table, specifically the top 5 rows.

   **Explanation:** This query selects the top 5 rows from the "Employees" table.

   **Generated Table:**
   | EmployeeID | Name       | Salary   | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------|----------|--------------|
   | 1          | John Doe   | 50000.00 | 101          |
   | 2          | Jane Smith | 60000.00 | 102          |
   | 3          | Alice Johnson | 55000.00 | 101        |
   | 4          | Bob Williams | 48000.00 | 103          |
   | 5          | Emily Brown | 52000.00 | 101          |

#### 2. **Using `TOP` with `ORDER BY` for Pagination:**
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID OFFSET 5 ROWS;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command is used for pagination, retrieving the next set of rows after skipping the first 5 rows, ordered by `EmployeeID`.

   **Explanation:** This query selects the next 5 rows from the "Employees" table after skipping the first 5 rows. It orders the results by `EmployeeID`.

   **Generated Table:**
   | EmployeeID | Name             | Salary   | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
   | 6          | Michael Davis    | 58000.00 | 102          |
   | 7          | Jessica Martinez | 53000.00 | 103          |
   | 8          | David Rodriguez  | 51000.00 | 101          |
   | 9          | Maria Garcia     | 59000.00 | 102          |
   | 10         | James Wilson     | 54000.00 | 103          |

#### 3. **Using `OFFSET FETCH` for Pagination:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY EmployeeID OFFSET 5 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
   ```
   **Purpose:** This command is also used for pagination, skipping the first 5 rows and fetching the next 5 rows from the "Employees" table, ordered by `EmployeeID`.

   **Explanation:** This query skips the first 5 rows and then fetches the next 5 rows from the "Employees" table. It orders the results by `EmployeeID`.

   **Generated Table:**
   | EmployeeID | Name             | Salary   | DepartmentID |
   |------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
   | 6          | Michael Davis    | 58000.00 | 102          |
   | 7          | Jessica Martinez | 53000.00 | 103          |
   | 8          | David Rodriguez  | 51000.00 | 101          |
   | 9          | Maria Garcia     | 59000.00 | 102          |
   | 10         | James Wilson     | 54000.00 | 103          |

**Purpose of the Exercise:** The purpose of this exercise is to learn and understand different methods for limiting and paginating query results in SQL, such as using `TOP`, `OFFSET`, `FETCH`, `DECLARE`, and `LIMIT`. These techniques are commonly used for optimizing database performance and enhancing user experience, especially when dealing with large datasets or implementing pagination in web applications.

- **`TOP`:** Used in T-SQL to limit the number of rows returned by a query.
- **`OFFSET` and `FETCH`:** Used in T-SQL to implement pagination by skipping a certain number of rows and then fetching a specified number of rows.
- **`DECLARE`:** Used in T-SQL to declare variables for use within a script or batch.
- **`LIMIT`:** Used in other SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

Understanding these techniques and their variations is crucial for efficient data retrieval and manipulation in SQL databases.
