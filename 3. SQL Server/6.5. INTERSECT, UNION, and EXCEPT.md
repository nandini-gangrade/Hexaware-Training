# INTERSECT, UNION, and EXCEPT

| Feature       | INTERSECT                           | UNION                               | EXCEPT                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**| Returns the common rows between two result sets | Combines two result sets and removes duplicates | Returns the rows that are present in the first result set but not in the second result set |
| **Usage**     | Useful when you want to find common records between two tables or result sets | Useful when you want to combine two tables or result sets, including duplicates | Useful when you want to find the difference between two tables or result sets |
| **Example**   | ```sql SELECT column1 FROM table1 INTERSECT SELECT column1 FROM table2; ``` | ```sql SELECT column1 FROM table1 UNION SELECT column1 FROM table2; ``` | ```sql SELECT column1 FROM table1 EXCEPT SELECT column1 FROM table2; ``` |

## Example

### Initial Table Creation:

#### Products Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(50),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    InStock CHAR(3)
);

INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Category, InStock) 
VALUES 
(1, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 'Yes'), 
(2, 'Smartphone', 'Electronics', 'No'), 
(3, 'Coffee Maker', 'Appliances', 'Yes'), 
(4, 'Blender', 'Appliances', 'Yes'), 
(5, 'T-shirt', 'Apparel', 'No');
```
**Generated Products Table:**
| ProductID | ProductName  | Category    | InStock |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 1         | Laptop       | Electronics | Yes     |
| 2         | Smartphone   | Electronics | No      |
| 3         | Coffee Maker | Appliances  | Yes     |
| 4         | Blender      | Appliances  | Yes     |
| 5         | T-shirt      | Apparel     | No      |

#### Orders Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(50),
    Quantity INT
);

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, ProductID, CustomerName, Quantity) 
VALUES 
(100, 1, 'Alice', 1), 
(101, 3, 'Bob', 2), 
(102, 2, 'Charlie', 1), 
(103, 4, 'Dana', 1), 
(104, 3, 'Alice', 1);
```
**Generated Orders Table:**
| OrderID | ProductID | CustomerName | Quantity |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 100     | 1         | Alice        | 1        |
| 101     | 3         | Bob          | 2        |
| 102     | 2         | Charlie      | 1        |
| 103     | 4         | Dana         | 1        |
| 104     | 3         | Alice        | 1        |

### Task 1: List all distinct products that are either in stock or have been ordered.
```sql
SELECT ProductID
FROM Products

UNION

SELECT ProductID
FROM Orders;
```
#### Explanation:
- This query uses `UNION` to combine all distinct product IDs from both the "Products" and "Orders" tables.
- It lists all distinct products that are either in stock or have been ordered.

### Task 2: Identify products that are both in stock and have been ordered.
```sql
SELECT ProductID
FROM Products

INTERSECT

SELECT ProductID
FROM Orders;
```
#### Explanation:
- This query uses `INTERSECT` to find common product IDs between the "Products" and "Orders" tables.
- It identifies products that are both in stock and have been ordered.

### Task 3: Find products that are in stock but have never been ordered.
```sql
SELECT ProductID
FROM Products

EXCEPT

SELECT ProductID
FROM Orders;
```
#### Explanation:
- This query uses `EXCEPT` to retrieve product IDs from the "Products" table that do not exist in the "Orders" table.
- It finds products that are in stock but have never been ordered.
