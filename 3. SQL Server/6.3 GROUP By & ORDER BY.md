### Queries

#### Query 1: Order by Region, SalesAmount desc

```sql
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeSales
ORDER BY Region, SalesAmount DESC;
```

- **Operator Used**: ORDER BY
- **Explanation**: This query retrieves all columns from the `EmployeeSales` table and orders the results by `Region` in ascending order and then by `SalesAmount` in descending order.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Sorting by region first groups sales from the same region together, and then sorting by sales amount in descending order helps identify the highest sales within each region.

**Generated Table**:

| EmployeeID | Region | Category    | Quarter | SalesAmount |
|------------|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 101        | North  | Electronics | Q2      | 1500.00     |
| 101        | North  | Electronics | Q1      | 1200.00     |
| 102        | North  | Clothing    | Q2      | 950.00      |
| 102        | North  | Clothing    | Q1      | 800.00      |
| 103        | South  | Electronics | Q1      | 1000.00     |
| 103        | South  | Clothing    | Q1      | 1200.00     |
| 104        | East   | Electronics | Q2      | 1150.00     |
| 104        | East   | Clothing    | Q2      | 500.00      |
| 105        | West   | Electronics | Q2      | 2100.00     |
| 105        | West   | Clothing    | Q2      | 1300.00     |
| 105        | West   | Electronics | Q1      | 1900.00     |
| 105        | West   | Clothing    | Q1      | 1100.00     |
<br>

#### Query 2: Order by Category, SalesAmount desc

```sql
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeSales
ORDER BY Category, SalesAmount DESC;
```

- **Operator Used**: ORDER BY
- **Explanation**: This query retrieves all columns from the `EmployeeSales` table and orders the results by `Category` in ascending order and then by `SalesAmount` in descending order.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Sorting by category first groups sales from the same category together, and then sorting by sales amount in descending order helps identify the highest sales within each category.

**Generated Table**:

| EmployeeID | Region | Category    | Quarter | SalesAmount |
|------------|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 105        | West   | Electronics | Q2      | 2100.00     |
| 105        | West   | Electronics | Q1      | 1900.00     |
| 105        | West   | Clothing    | Q2      | 1300.00     |
| 105        | West   | Clothing    | Q1      | 1100.00     |
| 101        | North  | Electronics | Q2      | 1500.00     |
| 101        | North  | Electronics | Q1      | 1200.00     |
| 104        | East   | Electronics | Q2      | 1150.00     |
| 103        | South  | Clothing    | Q1      | 1200.00     |
| 102        | North  | Clothing    | Q2      | 950.00      |
<br>

#### Query 3: Year to date sale Q1 today (How much sales?)

```sql
SELECT SUM(SalesAmount)
FROM EmployeeSales
WHERE Quarter = 'Q1';
```

- **Operator Used**: SUM
- **Explanation**: This query calculates the total sales amount for the first quarter ('Q1').
- **Approach and Intuition**: Filtering the data to include only sales from the first quarter ensures that we're summing the sales for that specific time period.

**Generated Table**:

| SUM(SalesAmount) |
|------------------|
| 4100.00          |
<br>

#### Query 4: Select Region, Category, Sum(SalesAmount)...

```sql
SELECT Region, Category, SUM(SalesAmount)
FROM EmployeeSales
GROUP BY Region, Category
ORDER BY Region, SUM(SalesAmount) DESC;
```

- **Operator Used**: GROUP BY, SUM, ORDER BY
- **Explanation**: This query groups the data by `Region` and `Category`, calculates the sum of `SalesAmount` for each group, and then orders the results by `Region` and the sum of `SalesAmount` in descending order within each region.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Grouping the data by region and category allows us to see the total sales amount for each combination, and ordering the results by region ensures that the regions are presented in alphabetical order with the highest sales amount first.

**Generated Table**:

| Region | Category    | SUM(SalesAmount) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| East   | Electronics | 1150.00          |
| East   | Clothing    | 500.00           |
| North  | Electronics | 2700.00          |
| North  | Clothing    | 1750.00          |
| South  | Electronics | 1000.00          |
| South  | Clothing    | 1200.00          |
| West   | Electronics | 4000.00          |
| West   | Clothing    | 2400.00          |
<br>

#### Query 5: Select Region, Sum(SalesAmount)...

```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(SalesAmount)
FROM EmployeeSales
GROUP BY Region;
```

- **Operator Used**: GROUP BY, SUM
- **Explanation**: This query groups the data by `Region` and calculates the sum of `SalesAmount` for each region.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Grouping the data by region allows us to see the total sales amount for each region.

**Generated Table**:

| Region | SUM(SalesAmount) |
|--------|------------------|
| North  | 4450.00          |
| South  | 2200.00          |
| East   | 1650.00          |
| West   | 6400.00          |
<br>

#### Query 6: Select [Quarter], Sum(SalesAmount)...

```sql
SELECT [Quarter], SUM(SalesAmount)
FROM EmployeeSales
GROUP BY [Quarter];
```

- **Operator Used**: GROUP BY, SUM
- **Explanation**: This query groups the data by `Quarter` and calculates the sum of `SalesAmount` for each quarter.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Grouping the data by quarter allows us to see the total sales amount for each quarter.

**Generated Table**:

| Quarter | SUM(SalesAmount) |
|---------|------------------|
| Q1      | 5300.00          |
| Q2      | 6950.00          |
<br>

#### Query 7: Grouping Sets R-C, R-Q, R, Q

```sql
SELECT Region, Category, [Quarter], SUM(SalesAmount)
FROM EmployeeSales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(
    (Region, Category),
    (Region, [Quarter]),
    (Region),
    ([Quarter])
);
```

- **Operator Used**: GROUP BY, GROUPING SETS, SUM
- **Explanation**: This query computes the sum of `SalesAmount` for various grouping combinations, including by region and category, region and quarter, region only, and quarter only.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Using GROUPING SETS allows for multiple levels of aggregation, providing insights into sales amounts at different hierarchical levels.

**Generated Table**:

| Region | Category    | Quarter | SUM(SalesAmount) |
|--------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| East   | Electronics | Q2      | 1150.00          |
| East   | Clothing    | Q2      | 500.00           |
| East   | Electronics | NULL    | 1150.00          |
| East   | Clothing    | NULL    | 500.00           |
| North  | Electronics | Q1      | 1200.00          |

| South  | Electronics | NULL    | 1000.00          |
| South  | Clothing    | NULL    | 1200.00          |
| West   | Electronics | Q1      | 1900.00          |
| West   | Electronics | Q2      | 2100.00          |
| West   | Clothing    | Q1      | 1100.00          |
| West   | Clothing    | Q2      | 1300.00          |

#### Query 8: Grouping Sets (continued)

```sql
SELECT Region, Category, [Quarter], SUM(SalesAmount)
FROM EmployeeSales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(
    (Region, Category),
    (Region, [Quarter]),
    (Region),
    ([Quarter])
)
ORDER BY GROUPING (Region), GROUPING (Category), GROUPING([Quarter]);
```

- **Operator Used**: GROUP BY, GROUPING SETS, SUM, ORDER BY, GROUPING
- **Explanation**: This query extends the previous query by ordering the results based on the grouping sets and indicating the groupings using the GROUPING function.
- **Approach and Intuition**: Ordering by the grouping sets and displaying the grouping indicators help understand the hierarchy and relationships between different levels of aggregation.

**Generated Table**:

| Region | Category    | Quarter | SUM(SalesAmount) |
|--------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| East   | Electronics | Q2      | 1150.00          |
