| Key Type       | Definition                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                     | Usage and Significance                                                                                       |

| Primary Key    | A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate entries.                                    | `EmpID` in Employees table                                                                  | Used to uniquely identify each record in the table and establish relationships with other tables.           |
| Candidate Key  | A candidate key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple (row) in a relation (table).                                                        | `{EmpLicence}` in Employees table                                                           | Serves as potential primary keys; ensures each row can be uniquely identified.                               |
| Foreign Key    | A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It enforces referential integrity in database relationships. | `Did` in Employees table, referencing `Did` in Designation table                           | Establishes relationships between tables; ensures data consistency by linking related information.           |
| Alternate Key  | An alternate key is a candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key.                                                                                   | `{EmpPassport}` in Employees table                                                          | Provides alternative unique identifiers if the primary key is not suitable for certain operations.          |
| Super Key      | A super key is a set of attributes within a table whose values can uniquely identify each row. It may contain more attributes than necessary for uniqueness.       | `{EmpID, EmpName}` in Employees table                                                        | Acts as a broader identifier than the primary key; useful in indexing and query optimization.               |
| Unique Key     | A unique key constraint ensures that all values in a column or a group of columns are unique. Unlike a primary key, a table can have multiple unique keys.        | `Designation` in Designation table                                                          | Ensures uniqueness within specified columns; useful for enforcing data integrity and constraints.           |
| Composite Key  | A composite key is a combination of two or more columns that together uniquely identify each row in a table.                                                  | `{EmpID, EmpLicence}` in Employees table                                                     | Ensures uniqueness by combining multiple attributes; used when no single attribute can uniquely identify each row.  |

## ACID Property

| ACID Property | Definition                                                                                                    | Example                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Atomicity     | Ensures that either all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none of them are.           | When transferring money between bank accounts, the entire transfer must either succeed (withdrawing from one account and depositing into the other) or fail. |
| Consistency   | Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after a transaction.                      | In a hotel booking system, if a room is booked, the system should ensure that the room is no longer available for booking.                            |
| Isolation     | Ensures that the execution of multiple transactions concurrently does not interfere with each other.          | If two people try to book the same hotel room at the same time, the system should handle it so that one booking doesn't affect the other.             |
| Durability    | Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will not be lost.             | Saving a document on your computer: once you save it, you expect it to be there even if your computer crashes.                                        |
