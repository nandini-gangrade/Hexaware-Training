# EXISTS VS NOT EXISTS

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Data Insertion
```sql
CREATE DATABASE projects;
USE projects;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(100),
    employee_id INT,
    start_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department) VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', 'Engineering'),
(2, 'Bob', 'Engineering'),
(3, 'Charlie', 'HR'),
(4, 'David', 'Marketing'),
(5, 'Sneha', 'Engineering');

INSERT INTO projects (project_id, project_name, employee_id, start_date) VALUES 
(101, 'Alpha', 1, '2021-01-10'),
(102, 'Beta', 2, '2021-03-15'),
(103, 'Gamma', 1, '2021-02-20');
```

### Step 2: View Data from Tables
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
**Generated Employees Table:**
| employee_id | name   | department   |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 1           | Alice  | Engineering  |
| 2           | Bob    | Engineering  |
| 3           | Charlie| HR           |
| 4           | David  | Marketing    |
| 5           | Sneha  | Engineering  |

```sql
SELECT * FROM projects;
```
**Generated Projects Table:**
| project_id | project_name | employee_id | start_date |
|------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 101        | Alpha        | 1           | 2021-01-10 |
| 102        | Beta         | 2           | 2021-03-15 |
| 103        | Gamma        | 1           | 2021-02-20 |


### Step 3: Query Employees from Engineering Department Working on Projects
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees o
WHERE department = 'Engineering' 
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM projects i 
    WHERE o.employee_id = i.employee_id
);
```

#### Explanation:
- **Intuition/Approach:** We want to find employees from the Engineering department who are actively involved in projects. To do this, we'll use the `EXISTS` operator to check if there are any records in the "projects" table for each employee in the Engineering department.
- **Code Breakdown:**
  - The outer query selects all columns from the "employees" table and aliases it as `o`.
  - We filter the results to include only employees from the Engineering department (`WHERE department = 'Engineering'`).
  - The `EXISTS` operator is used to check if there's at least one row in the "projects" table (`i`) where the `employee_id` matches with that of the outer query's employee (`o.employee_id`).
  - If such a row exists, the employee is included in the result.

### Step 4: Query Employees from Engineering Department Not Working on Any Project
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees o
WHERE department = 'Engineering' 
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM projects i 
    WHERE o.employee_id = i.employee_id
);
```

#### Explanation:
- **Intuition/Approach:** Here, we want to identify employees from the Engineering department who are not assigned to any project. We'll use the `NOT EXISTS` operator to filter out employees who have no corresponding records in the "projects" table.
- **Code Breakdown:**
  - Similar to Step 3, the outer query selects all columns from the "employees" table and aliases it as `o`.
  - We again filter the results to include only employees from the Engineering department (`WHERE department = 'Engineering'`).
  - The `NOT EXISTS` operator checks if there are no rows in the "projects" table (`i`) where the `employee_id` matches with that of the outer query's employee (`o.employee_id`).
  - If no such row exists, the employee is included in the result.

#### Operators Explanation:
- **EXISTS:** This operator checks if a subquery returns any rows. If the subquery returns at least one row, the result of the EXISTS operator is true, otherwise false.
- **NOT EXISTS:** This operator is the negation of EXISTS. It returns true if the subquery returns no rows.
